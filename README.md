# Dealing-with-bimodally-distributed-maxent-sdm

0. Introduction

   So in my modeling for Calidris alpina (Dunlin), I find something interesting.
   The MaxEnt performance of bootstrapped lasso regression is bimodally distributed.
   Then I wonder why, so I distributed a simulation program to generate randomly distributed points across Nouvelle Aquitaine.
   And then do bootstrapped maxent-based sdm...

   Set what happens.
